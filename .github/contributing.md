# contributor guide

## before contributing

### code of conduct

Contributions of all kinds are welcome - this project aims to be
inclusive and open. Please read the [Code of Conduct](code_of_conduct.md)
before making any contributions.

### check current status

Try to search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/citycide/trilogy/issues)
before opening a new one - it's possible your issue has already been noted,
fixed, or otherwise handled.

## code style

[![JavaScript Style Guide](https://cdn.rawgit.com/standard/standard/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/standard/standard)

When making changes, do your best to match the existing code style.
This project uses [`standard`](https://github.com/standard/standard).
The most common rules are [listed here](https://github.com/standard/standard#the-rules).

## pull requests

1. Fork the project on GitHub
2. Clone the project locally ( `git clone https://github.com/{YOUR_USERNAME}/{PROJECT_NAME}.git` )
3. Create a new branch with a relevant name ( `git checkout -b feat-make-better` )
4. Run `npm install` to get any necessary dependencies
5. Make your changes and run `npm run build`
6. Run `npm test` to make sure all tests continue to pass, and it never hurts to have more tests
7. Push your changes ( `git push` )
8. Go to your fork on GitHub to submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/) :tada:

### notes

* New features aren't guaranteed to be merged - it'll be up to you and the
  community to make a convincing case
* It's generally expected that new features come with tests and documentation,
  so do your best to add both of those with your pull request

## issues

You should always include as much information as possible about the problem -
help maintainers and contributors help you back:

* relevant error messages ( including stack traces )
* any uncommon or "abnormal" environment configurations
* link to a [minimal reproducible][mcve] case, ie. a GitHub repo
  ( this is the fastest way to a solution! )

### labels

#### type labels

For the most part, the `type` labels correspond to the commit types
from the [Angular commit guidelines][angular] used here, though not
all of them are represented. So if an issue is labeled with
`type: performance`, it'll probably be closed by a commit like
`perf(someMethod): optimize some particular method`.

#### status labels

A `status` label is a progress indicator on an issue - whether it's
being worked on, waiting for release, being investigated, etc.

An issue marked with `status: accepted` is one that's been given the
green light but isn't being worked on - so a pull request would be
welcome and accepted.

On the other hand, one marked with `status: declined` is a change
that isn't desired or one that might be revisited in the future.

#### tag labels

Most labels without a prefix like `status: ` or `type: ` are general
tags that can be applied to any issue, commonly combined with a `type`
or `status` such as `type: feature` + `breaking`, `type: bug` +
`good first PR`, or `status: in progress` + `discussion`.

Some tag labels are just indicators that won't be used with status or
type labels. `invalid` is usually used alone to indicate that an issue
isn't an actual issue with the project. `meta` is generally used for
issues relating to the repository itself on GitHub, for example
relating to this contributor guide.
